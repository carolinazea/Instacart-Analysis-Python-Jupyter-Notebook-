Instacart, an online grocery store is a grocery delivery and pick-up service that operates in the United States and Canada. The service allows customers to order groceries from participating retailers with the shopping being completed by a personal shopper. Instacart wants to find more information in reagrds to their sales patterns. 

Open-source data is used

As a data analyst, I was tasked to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of their data in order to derive insights and deliver strategies that can ameliorate Instacart's business decisions. Focusing on customer behavior such as spending habits and whether it effects the sale of Instacart's products are necessary to complete this task. 


Stakeholders would like to know:
busiest days/hours of the week
times of days when people spend the most money 
the types of products high in demand 
products in grocery departments that are most popular 
customer regions
customer profiles including demographic information
differences in ordering habits based on customer profiles
